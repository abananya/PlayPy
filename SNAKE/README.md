# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Pygame library of Python. In this game, the players control a snake and try to eat the fruit while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body and the boundaries.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame 2.x

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Pygame library by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install pygame==2.0.0.dev22
   ```

3. Run the `main.py` script to start the game:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. Use the arrow keys (Left, Right, Up, Down) to control the snake's movement. 

6. New apples keep appearing once an apple is eaten.

7. The game ends if the snake hits the game boundaries or collides with its own body.

8. Try to achieve the highest score by eating as many apples as possible!
