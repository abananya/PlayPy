# Space Invader

This is a simple implementation of the classic Space Invader game using the Pygame library of Python. The players have to shoot enemy UFOs to kill them before they reach the player's spaceship.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Pygame library by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. Run the `main.py` script to start the game:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. Use the arrow keys (Left, Right) to control the movement of the spaceship.

5. Use the Spacebar to shoot at the UFOs. 

6. The UFOs will keep on coming automatically, and your goal is to prevent them from reaching your spaceship.

7. The game ends if one of the UFOs touches your spaceship.

8. Try to achieve the highest score by killing as many UFOs as possible!
